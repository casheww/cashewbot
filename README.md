# CashewBot
A small general purpose Discord bot written with discord.py. An amalgamation of ideas stolen from other bots, + a few of my own.

If you'd like to add this bot to your server, you can use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=706534185992454198&permissions=67628112&scope=bot). I'd rather didn't run your own instance, and my database structure is so stupid I would warn against it for the sake of your braincells.

### Neat features:
- in-Discord Uno games
- Spotify artist and track searching
- language translation commands
- NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day command
- counting game + Fibonacci mode that nobody likes :(
- server-bound birthdays
- OpenWeatherMap command
- use of the HTTP cat API
